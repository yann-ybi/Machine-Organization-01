Yann Youbi, I work individually.

I had some help from my professor and TAs
Dr. Noah Daniels helped me confirming that my brightness code gives the correct output and told me to make sure it handles standard input too. A TA explain to me some of the lines of codes we've seen in class and another one explain to me how the match function works in rust.

We could use the fgroups program to identify families from a list of names. Each line starting with the last name followed by the first name. The program would return first names of relatives grouped together. And omit the names of those who do not have any relative in the list.

I don't know exactly how long I've spent but it did take about 2 days to complete it including time spent wasted on a working code.
